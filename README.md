<h3>üìù About My Project:</h3>
Here are five key points about the "JobTex" project that combines React, React Router, Firebase user authentication,MongoDB  and jwt token:

- **1.Front-End in React**: The project's front-end is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive cosmetic product pages and a user-friendly interface.
- **2.React Router for Navigation:**: React Router is used to implement client-side routing within the application. It enables smooth navigation between different sections of the cosmetics website, including product pages, user profiles, and the shopping cart.
- **3.Firebase for User Authentication:**: Firebase, a comprehensive cloud-based platform, is integrated to manage user authentication. Users can register and log in securely to access features such as personalized shopping carts and product recommendations.
- **4.MongoDB Database:**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is utilized to store product information, user data, and shopping cart details. It provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution for the cosmetics project.
- **5.JWT:**: SON Web Tokens (JWT) are a powerful tool for enhancing the security and functionality of your website. JWTs are compact, self-contained tokens that can be used for a variety of purposes, including user authentication, data exchange, and access control..
